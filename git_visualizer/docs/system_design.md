## Implementation approach

We will use Flask for the web application, GitPython for git operations, google-cloud-bigquery for BigQuery operations, matplotlib for 3D graph generation, and OpenAI's Ada model for text comparison. We will design a smart key system using SQLAlchemy ORM for efficient data storage and retrieval. To avoid hitting API thresholds, we will implement a chunking method that splits the user's text into smaller pieces before sending it to the API.

## Data structures and interface definitions

        class User{
            +int id
            +str name
            +str email
            +__init__(id: int, name: str, email: str)
        }
        class Project{
            +int id
            +str name
            +int user_id
            +User user
            +__init__(id: int, name: str, user_id: int, user: User)
        }
        class Version{
            +int id
            +str content
            +datetime timestamp
            +int project_id
            +Project project
            +__init__(id: int, content: str, timestamp: datetime, project_id: int, project: Project)
        }
        User "1" -- "*" Project: has
        Project "1" -- "*" Version: has
    

## Program call flow


    sequenceDiagram
        participant U as User
        participant P as Project
        participant V as Version
        participant G as git_operations
        participant B as bigquery_operations
        participant Gr as graph_generator
        participant A as api_chunker
        U->>P: create_project(name)
        P->>V: create_version(content)
        V->>G: save_version()
        G->>B: save_to_bigquery()
        B->>Gr: generate_graph()
        Gr->>A: chunk_text()
        A->>Gr: compare_text()
        Gr->>U: display_graph()
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The calculation method for the similarity-advancement-coherency axis is unclear. More information is needed on how to implement the smart call text-chunk-sample method.
