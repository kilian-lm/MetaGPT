## Logic Analysis

- ['main.py', 'Contains the main entry of the application, should initialize all necessary third-party libraries']
- ['git_operations.py', 'Contains all git related operations, should be implemented after main.py']
- ['bigquery_operations.py', 'Contains all BigQuery related operations, should be implemented after git_operations.py']
- ['graph_generator.py', 'Responsible for generating 3D graphs, should be implemented after bigquery_operations.py']
- ['api_chunker.py', "Responsible for splitting user's text into smaller pieces, should be implemented after graph_generator.py"]
- ['models.py', 'Contains the definition of User, Project and Version classes, should be implemented first']

## Task list

- models.py
- main.py
- git_operations.py
- bigquery_operations.py
- graph_generator.py
- api_chunker.py

## Shared Knowledge


        'models.py' contains the definition of User, Project and Version classes. 'main.py' is the main entry of the application and should initialize all necessary third-party libraries. 'git_operations.py' is responsible for all git related operations. 'bigquery_operations.py' is responsible for all BigQuery related operations. 'graph_generator.py' is responsible for generating 3D graphs. 'api_chunker.py' is responsible for splitting user's text into smaller pieces.
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The calculation method for the similarity-advancement-coherency axis is unclear. More information is needed on how to implement the smart call text-chunk-sample method.
