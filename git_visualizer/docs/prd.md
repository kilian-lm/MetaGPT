## Original Requirements

Develop a Python application that allows non-developers to utilize git versioning. The user should be able to input text which is saved to BigQuery using the BigQuery client. The application should have a smart primary key, foreign key system. A 3D graph should be generated based on user input with the axes being versions, time, and similarity-advancement-coherency. The similarity-advancement-coherency axis should be based on embedding comparison by a call to OpenAI's Ada model. The application should implement a smart call text-chunk-sample method to avoid hitting API thresholds.

## Product Goals

- Create an intuitive interface for non-developers to utilize git versioning
- Implement a smart key system for efficient data storage and retrieval
- Visualize data in a 3D graph to track versions, time, and similarity-advancement-coherency

## User Stories

- As a non-developer, I want to be able to use git versioning so that I can track changes to my projects
- As a user, I want my data to be stored efficiently so that I can retrieve it quickly
- As a user, I want to visualize my data in a 3D graph so that I can easily understand the progress of my project
- As a user, I want the application to avoid hitting API thresholds so that I can continue to use it without interruptions

## Competitive Analysis

- GitHub: Provides git versioning but lacks a user-friendly interface for non-developers
- Bitbucket: Offers git versioning but does not provide a 3D graph for data visualization
- GitLab: Allows git versioning but does not have a smart key system for efficient data storage and retrieval
- SourceTree: Offers a graphical interface for git but does not integrate with BigQuery
- Tower: Provides a user-friendly interface for git but does not offer a 3D graph for data visualization

## Requirement Analysis

The product requires a user-friendly interface for non-developers to utilize git versioning. It also needs a smart key system for efficient data storage and retrieval. The product should visualize data in a 3D graph to track versions, time, and similarity-advancement-coherency. The application should avoid hitting API thresholds.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Develop a user-friendly interface for git versioning']
- ['P0', 'Implement a smart key system for efficient data storage and retrieval']
- ['P1', 'Visualize data in a 3D graph']
- ['P1', 'Implement a method to avoid hitting API thresholds']

## UI Design draft

The UI should be simple and intuitive. It should have a text input field for user data, a 'Save' button to store the data in BigQuery, and a 'Generate Graph' button to create the 3D graph. The graph should be displayed on the same page, below the input field and buttons. The UI should use a clean, modern design with a light color scheme.

## Anything UNCLEAR

It's unclear how the similarity-advancement-coherency axis is calculated. More information is needed on how to implement the smart call text-chunk-sample method.
